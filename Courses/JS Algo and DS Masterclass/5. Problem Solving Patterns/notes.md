# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency Counter

- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings

## Multiple Pointers

- Creating pointer or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

## Sliding window

## Divide and Conquer

## Dynamic programming

## Greedy algorithms

## Backtracking
